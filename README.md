## PROBLEM STATEMENT
**KPI'S REQUIREMENT**

We need to analyze key indicators for our pizza sales data to gain insights into our business performance. Specifically, we want to calculate the following metrics:
* **Total Revenue:** The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.
* **Average Order Value:** The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.
* **Total Pizzas Sold:** The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.
* **Total Orders:** The total number of orders placed.
* **Average Pizzas Per Order:** The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.

**CHARTS REQUIREMENT**

We would like to visualize various aspects of our pizza sales data to gain insights and understand key trends. We have identified the following requirements for creating charts:
* **Daily Trend for Total Orders:**
Create a bar chart that displays the daily trend of total orders over a specific time period. This chart will help us identify any patterns or fluctuations in order volumes on a daily basis.
* **Monthly Trend for Total Orders:**
Create a line chart that illustrates the hourly trend of total orders throughout the day. This chart will allow us to identify peak hours or periods of high order activity.
* **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category:**
Create a pie chart that shows the distribution of sales across different pizza categories. This chart will provide insights into the popularity of various pizza categories and their contribution to overall sales.
